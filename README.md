I plan to make a simple app allowing one to input their own art and sort it in a way that will work for them. With each category of art you can list different projects, they can even be specified as done or not done. 

I used:
Express.js
MySQL
Sequilize 
Insomnia 
Heroku 

As a user I need to have an organized list of my projects. 
That way I can see what projects I have and what is finished. 
As a user I will be able to add and delete projects at will using POST and GET routes.
That way I can update my art as it sells or is completed.


NEXT STEPS!
Add a front end, this way the art can actually be seen.
Mark how many art works each artist has within the system, and be able to pull them all up with the artist name.


STRUGGLES
I had a lot to catch up on and on top of that I was solo! It was really fun to make something that was fully mine. 
Everyone of the TA's and Vincent were able to help me out with all the fine details.

There were a LOT of fine details. 
Routing is so name specific, one incorrect capitalized letter or an 's' will throw off and break all of your code :)
