Art organization 


init
two tables
one for art 
one for artists


I plan to make a simple app allowing one to input their own art and sort it in a way that will work for them. With each category of art you can list different projects, they can even be specified as done or not done. 

Express.js
MySQL
Sequilize 
Insomnia 
Heroku 

As a user I need to have an organized list of my projects. 
That way I can see what projects I have and what is finished. 
As a user I will be able to add and delete projects at will using POST and GET routes.
That way I can update my art as it sells or is completed.
